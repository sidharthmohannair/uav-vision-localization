- Fundamental matching algorithms
### Version 2.0.0
Feature enhancements:
- Improved feature matching
- Optimized detector parameters
- Enhanced visualization tools
- Better performance metrics
### Version 3.0.0
Error handling improvements:
- Basic position error calculation
- Initial visualization system
- Enhanced test cases
- Improved validation methods
### Version 4.0.0
Focus on accuracy:
- Position error tracking implementation

## Running Legacy Versions

### Environment Setup
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
pip install -r requirements_legacy.txt
```

### Execution
Each version can be run independently:
```bash
python visul_drone_locl_TestSuite_v<version>.py
```

### Test Results
Results for each version are preserved in corresponding directories:
```bash
results/
├── v1_results/
├── v2_results/
└── ...
```

## Implementation Notes
- Each version builds upon lessons learned from previous implementations
- Code comments explain key algorithmic decisions
- Test results demonstrate incremental improvements
- Documentation captures design evolution

## Transition to Modern Implementation
The latest production version has been restructured into a modular architecture. See the `main` branch for the current implementation.
